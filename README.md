# Optimal synthesis of multi output boolean functions using ILP

Optimal solution to the problem of the synthesize of a given multi-output boolean function into a two level circuit (SOP).

It uses a variant of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to enumerate the all implicants of the boolean function and find its optimal synthesis using `intlinprog`.
