# Optimal synthesis of multi output boolean functions using ILP

Matlab implementation of the ILP problem which optimally synthesize a multi-output Boolean function into a two-level circuit. 

Utilizes a variant of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to enumerate all implicants and employs `intlinprog` to find the optimal synthesis.
